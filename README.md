This is a bot that checks court availability in my tennis club by scrapping the website and notifies me about it via Telegram. I have been using it since 2020 since when booking a court in London became a nightmare. 
This was never intended to be a public project, therefore: 
- It still has some above-average level of hardcode inside (for example, it won't show any courts on weekdays before 6pm because I work and it won't send any notifications during the hours that I sleep)
- I can't give usage instructions as I expect to remain its sole user ;) 
- I moved all the tests to a private repository because test data compromises some internal structure of the website of the tennis club, and I won't do it to the best tennis club in the world <3.
